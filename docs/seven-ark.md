# Seven Ark – The Seven Design Perspectives

**Seven Ark** is a practical extension of the CORE Framework, offering seven in-depth perspectives to help review and refine complex system architectures.

---

## 🌈 Why "Seven Ark"?

- **Seven** symbolizes completeness—like the seven colors of the rainbow or seven notes of a musical scale.
- **Ark** is a vessel that preserves and carries what's important across time and change.

Together, *Seven Ark* is a vessel of design wisdom to help your architecture stand the test of time.

## 🧭 The Seven Perspectives

| No | Viewpoint         | Icon | Key Question |
|----|--------------------|------|---------------|
| 1  | **Purpose**         | 🎯   | Why does this system exist? |
| 2  | **Responsibility**  | 🧩   | Who is responsible for what? |
| 3  | **Structure**       | 🏗   | How are modules and boundaries defined? |
| 4  | **State**           | 🔁   | What states exist and how do they change? |
| 5  | **Verifiability**   | 🧪   | Can it be tested, traced, or observed? |
| 6  | **Evolution**       | 🔄   | Will this adapt to future changes? |
| 7  | **Explainability**  | 🧠   | Can others understand and explain it clearly? |

These perspectives act as lenses to inspect your design from multiple dimensions.

## 🔄 Relation to CORE Framework

| CORE Viewpoint | Seven Ark Perspective         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Context        | Purpose                       |
| Object         | Responsibility, Structure     |
| Reaction       | State, Verifiability          |
| Evolution      | Evolution, Explainability     |

**CORE** guides **what to ask**, while **Seven Ark** guides **how to evaluate**.  
They work best as a unified system.
