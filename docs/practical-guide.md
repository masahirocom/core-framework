# Practical Worksheet for the CORE Framework

This template supports real-world design reviews using the CORE perspectives:  
**Context, Object, Reaction, and Evolution.**

## 📋 Basic Information

- **Project Name**:
- **System/Feature**:
- **Author/Team**:
- **Date**:
- **Phase**: □ Requirements  □ Basic Design  □ Detailed Design  □ Pre-Implementation  □ Improvement

---

## C: Context – Purpose & Environment 🎯

> *Who is it for? Why now? What are the constraints?*

### Key Questions
- Who are the users or stakeholders?
- What value does this system/feature provide?
- What constraints (time, budget, tech) are present?

### Checklist
- [ ] Users and stakeholders are clearly identified
- [ ] The purpose is specifically described
- [ ] Constraints are known and documented
- [ ] Business priorities and trade-offs are defined

### Notes

```
(Insights / concerns / decisions from the Context perspective)
```

---

## O: Object – Responsibilities & Structure 🧩

> *Who owns what? How is it divided?*

### Key Questions
- What are the system’s main components?
- What are the responsibilities of each?
- How are they connected?

### Checklist
- [ ] Component boundaries are defined
- [ ] Responsibilities are clearly allocated with no overlap
- [ ] Ownership of data and logic is clear
- [ ] Interfaces are explicitly defined

### Notes

```
(Insights / concerns / decisions from the Object perspective)
```

---

## R: Reaction – States & Change 🔁

> *What changes? What are the side effects?*

### Key Questions
- What are the key system states?
- How do states transition?
- What side effects occur with each operation?

### Checklist
- [ ] State transitions are mapped and documented
- [ ] Error and exception handling is considered
- [ ] Data flow is understood
- [ ] Test strategy and verification approach are clear

### Notes

```
(Insights / concerns / decisions from the Reaction perspective)
```

---

## E: Evolution – Scalability & Communication 🔄

> *Will it hold up over time and across teams?*

### Key Questions
- Can the design handle future changes?
- Is it easy to explain to a new team member?
- Is the design maintainable and operable?

### Checklist
- [ ] The design accommodates future requirements
- [ ] Changes have limited, predictable impact
- [ ] Naming is consistent and intuitive
- [ ] The design rationale is documented

### Notes

```
(Insights / concerns / decisions from the Evolution perspective)
```

---

## ✅ Overall Review Summary

### Strengths

```
(What’s working well from each perspective)
```

### Concerns & Suggestions

```
(What needs improvement, alternatives, or more analysis)
```

### Action Items

| Action Item | Owner | Due Date | Priority |
|-------------|-------|----------|----------|
|             |       |          |          |
|             |       |          |          |

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Match to Project Phase**
   - Early stages: focus on C and O
   - Detail stage: balance across all
   - Post-release: focus on R and E

2. **Team Communication**
   - Use CORE terms in design discussions
   - Identify weaknesses directly: "The R view is unclear"

3. **Customization**
   - Adjust checklists for your project’s complexity
   - Expand specific questions as needed

4. **Iterative Review**
   - Reuse the template regularly to track evolution
   - Use it for retrospective analysis of past design decisions
