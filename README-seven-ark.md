# Seven Ark – The Seven Perspectives of System Design

**Seven Ark** is a framework of seven essential design perspectives, crafted to guide engineers, architects, and teams through the complexity of modern system design.  
It serves as a practical thinking tool—like a compass or map—to uncover weaknesses, clarify intentions, and strengthen your architecture.

## 🌈 Why "Seven Ark"?

- **Seven** represents completeness, insight, and coverage—like the 7 colors of a spectrum or 7 notes of a scale.
- **Ark** symbolizes both a vessel of wisdom and a structure built to endure.
- Together, *Seven Ark* represents a vessel of design wisdom that carries your system through time, scale, and complexity.

## 🧭 The 7 Perspectives

| # | Name             | Icon | Key Question |
|---|------------------|------|---------------|
| 1 | **Purpose**       | 🎯   | Who is this for, and why? |
| 2 | **Responsibility**| 🧩   | Who owns what responsibility? |
| 3 | **Structure**     | 🏗   | How is the system organized? |
| 4 | **State**         | 🔁   | What states exist, and what changes? |
| 5 | **Verifiability** | 🧪   | Can the behavior be tested and confirmed? |
| 6 | **Evolution**     | 🔄   | Will the system withstand future change? |
| 7 | **Explainability**| 🧠   | Can this be clearly explained and shared? |

Each of these perspectives helps clarify a different layer of your system, and together they ensure your architecture is solid, scalable, and sharable.

## 🧪 Example Prompts

- "What’s the most critical **Purpose** of this module?"
- "Are **Responsibilities** clearly separated?"
- "How do **States** evolve through this workflow?"
- "Can this feature be **Verified** independently?"
- "Is this design easy to **Explain** to a new member?"

---

## 🔧 How It Complements CORE

**CORE (Context, Object, Reaction, Evolution)** is ideal for high-level design discussion.

**Seven Ark** complements CORE by adding granularity:
- Purpose ↔ Context
- Responsibility & Structure ↔ Object
- State & Verifiability ↔ Reaction
- Evolution & Explainability ↔ Evolution

Together, they form a complete design reflection system.
