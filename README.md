# CORE Framework

The **CORE Framework** is a design thinking compass based on four powerful questions: Context, Object, Reaction, and Evolution.  
It helps teams uncover weak points in architecture, design, and strategy by asking the right questions at the right time.

## Key Questions

| CORE | Question                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| C: Context   | Who is it for and for what purpose?        |
| O: Object    | What responsibilities does this structure serve? |
| R: Reaction  | What changes when this action is taken?    |
| E: Evolution | Can this design withstand future changes?  |
